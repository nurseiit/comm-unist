## To get GPIO Emulator work on your machine
1. Your machine should run either OSX or Linux, it probably won't run on Windows
2. You should have an installed **tkinter** library on python3. You can install it on Linux via:
```
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```
3. Then, open the **playground.ipynb** via *Jupyter Notebook*.
4. There's one little problem here: *you have to restart the kernel **everytime** you change your code*. You might also see the
   GPIO Window sometimes lag (does not close immediately after restarting).
