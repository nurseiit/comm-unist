### Notes

- You are expected to be familiar with the concept of `branch` in `git`.
  - Grader will create and push branches named `grader-<lab_name>`. For example, `grader-lab0`.
  - Later labs will pushed to either `master` or `deploy-<lab_name>` branch.


- For later labs being deployed through non-master branch, you may want to
obtain them by:

```
git pull
git branch -a
git checkout -t origin/deploy-lab2
```
