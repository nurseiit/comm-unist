### Notes

- You are expected to be familiar with the concept of `branch` in `git`.
- Grader will create and push branches named `grader-<lab_name>`. For example, `grader-lab0`.
- Grader will first check `submit-labx` branches (e.g., `submit-lab2`) and if it does not exist,
will check the `master` branch.
