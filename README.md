Lab infra
---------

`Gitlab URL for the class: https://class.unicss.org`

You (will) receive a reset password email from hyungon.moon.helper@gmail.com
that give you an account to the class Gitlab. You username is your studenr id
(e.g. 20081234)

Once logged in, you should have an access to the two repositories under
a group of name `cse221-2019-spring`. Under the group, you will find two
repositories. `cse221-2019-spring` is where you can ask questions and the announcements will
be posted. `submit-<student_id>` is your private repository where you should
submit labs, and your grade will be posted.

Before cloning and working with the lab repository, you may want to create and
register your ssh key by following this instruction.
