Inside "sym.password" it checks for the length of the input should be 16.

Also, strtoul of the beginning of that string should equal 31337.

First string is: "31337qwertyuiopl"

Then it asks for 5 integers (a, b, c, d, e) and does the following math (or similar):

result = a + d + e

And the expected result is "1457664".

So setting a = 1457664, b = c = d = e = 0 was enough to unlock the flag.
