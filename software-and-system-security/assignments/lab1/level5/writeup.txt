String length is 8.

And there's a loop.

Near the end it checks for "5385876381" with each digit xor-ed with 1.

But that's "4294967290" and is too long.

Notice that before checking it does snprintf, so if we pass a certain negative value, it will convert to our desired value.

But unsigned "4294967290" to singed is "-6".

We can add 0s after "-" to get "-0000006".

Which unblocks the flag.
