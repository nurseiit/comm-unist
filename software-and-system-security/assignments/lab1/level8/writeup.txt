The lucky number is generated randomly as below:
```
	srand(time(NULL));
	int lucky_number = rand() % 20 + 15;
```

Examining the "password" method allowed to generate a simple emulator in python:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    keys = 3
    words = 4
    for i in range(LUCKY_NUMBER):
        a = words
        tmp = a
        a = keys
        a += words
        words = a
        a = tmp
        keys = a
    print(words)
```

I've got 31 as a lucky number. Then using the helper above, I was able to
calculate the key as 12752043.
