## To get GPIO Emulator work on your machine (Not valid Anymore!)

**Upd: from Spring 2019, Course Syllabus does not have anything to do with hardware or Raspberry at all.**

1. Your machine should run either OSX or Linux, it probably won't run on Windows
2. You should have an installed **tkinter** library on python3. You can install it on Linux via:
```
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```
3. Then, open the **playground.ipynb** via *Jupyter Notebook*.
4. There's one little problem here: *you have to restart the kernel **everytime** you change your code*. You might also see the
   GPIO Window sometimes lag (does not close immediately after restarting).
## Guide on 'How to not suck on Midterms'
1. You must be able to solve tricky Python questions like:
   - Guessing the output of some functions.
   - Dealing with list shortcuts (s[1:5]) and len(s) function
   - Understand difference btw // and / operators.
   - Write and understand every single code from presentation slides (except for *numpy* and *plotting* libraries -- memorize'em :smiley: ).
2. You must remember every single detail of the code from ppts. (Except GPIO ports, you won't need to 
remember the board) Otherwise, even if your code works perfectly, they will deduct 
points as for your code is different. *(Yeah, that sucks, I know, everyone knows that -- yet no one's taking any action)*
3. Read and understand the definitions of UART, SPI and I2C stuff + Event Triggers/Listeners. **(Not valid Anymore!)**
4. Must be able to list Neural Network's composition. **(Not valid Anymore!)**

In short, they won't even listen to you if your code is fine but it looks different from the reference solution. Thus, you must not 
rely on your coding abilities *(even if you went to ACM ICPC World Finals)*, it won't make any difference. Instead, focus on
understanding the definitions and remembering the details from slides.

IMHO, this is the most *Korean Stereotypical* course I've ever happened to take. 
*~(You are not correct unless your answer is 100% the same)*

**Edit 1:** Heheh, ironically it appears that I was wrong about this very part, it *is* one of the most of *that* type courses, though it doesn't even get near the all time (for now) best (or worst, you bet) from that category, OOP taught by S.K. It needs a dedicated blog post on its own.
