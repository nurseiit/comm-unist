"""
Today's objective is to manipulate data in a time series and practice with the basics of matplotlib,
while working with data about currency values.
â€‹
The files GBP2USD.txt and JPY2USD.txt contain historical daily values of GBP (pounds) and JPY (yen) against the US dollar.
For instance, the entry "2017-09-28	112.74" in JPY2USD.txt means that, on sept 28th 2017, it took 112.74 yen to buy 1 US dollar
(or, in other words, that 1 US dollar was worth 112.74)

Example of the plots to be printed as output of these functions are given (see .png files in this package)

file_management_example.py shows how to read data from a file
